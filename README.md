# slime-bottle

Fabric Minecraft mod that adds a drinkable slime bottle.

You have found that forcing slime through the narrow neck of a glass bottle thoroughly tenderises the gelatinous substance, so that a sufficiently dedicated individual could consume it (though doing so voluntarily would put their intellectual competence into question).

Item can be obtained by crafting (glass bottle and slime ball) or by interacting with a small slime while holding a glass bottle.

Gives extra powerful nausea effect when drunk.
